## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS/Sass
- CSS grid
- Flexbox
- Media queries

### What I learned

This challenge was all about using the CSS grid. The layout needed a bit more tweaking than the previous challenges, so the media queries were also more numerous and complex.

### Useful resources

As I got to use Font Awesome icons in this project, I gave myself a challenge to learn more about making icons accessible by using [this guide](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/dig-deeper/accessibility) as a starting point for my research.
